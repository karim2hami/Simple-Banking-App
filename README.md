# Simple-Banking-App

This basic java command-line application is my first little project I coded with Java.
The application has the functions of an ATM interface:
- check your current account balance
- make a deposit on your account
- make a withdrawal from your account
- view your previous transactions 
- calculate interest for a defined amount of money from your account
